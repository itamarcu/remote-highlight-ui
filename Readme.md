Useful for teaching people the UI remotely, or bringing attention to things (e.g. the end turn button).
Serves a similar purpose to pings on the canvas, but for the UI.

To activate, Ctrl+Aux-Click on a UI element.  The element will be highlighted on all other players' screens.
"Aux-Click" is right-click, middle-click, or even stuff like a mouse's side button mapped to "Forward".
